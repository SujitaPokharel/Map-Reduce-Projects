This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a prototype of :

  Creating MapReduce program to calculating pi 
    Step 1: Create a Java program which accepts two command line arguments  R: The radius  N: The number of (x, y) pairs to create 
      The Java program then randomly generates N pairs of (x, y) and displays them on the standard output
        Sample random numbers generator:
        
        System.out.println("Enter an integer:"); 
        Scanner input =new Scanner(System.in); 
        int index = input.nextInt(); 
        int num[] = new int[index]; 
        for(int i=0;i<index;i++){
          num[i] = (int)(Math.random()*index);
          System.out.print(num[i]+" ");
         }
         
         
    Step 2: Run the program created in Step 1 and save the result in a file.
    Step 3: Create a MapReduce program to calculate pi
    Step 4: Use the file generated in Step 2 as the input to execute the MapReduce program created in Step 3. 
    
    
    Note: We have square shaped board which has the circular dart patterns inside. 
          We will calculate pi value from the total number of the darts thrown.
          I have used following formula to calcu;ate Pi value. The Pi value is 3.14 approximately
          
    For example,
          I used only Map Task and Reduce Task to compute Pi value.  
          Radius = 2 
          Number of Pairs = 2000 
          
          From My MapReduce program PiCalculation: 
          Darts thrown Inside, Inside   = 1559  
          Darts thrown Outside, Outside  = 441 
          Pi  = 4 * (S / N) 
           = 4 * (Inside / (Inside + Outside)) 
           = 4 * (1559 / (1559 + 441)) 
           = 4* 0.7795 
           = 3.12
