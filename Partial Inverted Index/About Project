This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a prototype of :
  
  Partial Inverted Index   
  Please implement mapreduce programs to show the partial inverted index for the following these three files: 
 
 Input:
  file0's content -> "it is what it is" 
  file1's content -> "what is it" 
  file2's content -> "it is a banana" 
  
 Output:
  OutputFile ->
    a { file2.txt } 
    banana: { file2.txt } 
    is: { file0.txt file1.txt file2.txt } 
    it: { file0.txt file1.txt file2.txt} 
    what: { file0.txt file1.txt} 
    
    Explanation: We have to find the location of respective word (whether it's repeated or not) in each file 
                 and display in ascending order. 
    
    
 Note: In this project I will upload only the .java file as I already have given smaple details in 
        https://github.com/SujitaPokharel/Map-Reduce-Projects/tree/master/Count%20Occurrence%20of%20First%20Character%20of%20Each%20word%20in%20all%20Files
