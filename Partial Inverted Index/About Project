This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a prototype of :
  
  Partial Inverted Index   
  Please implement mapreduce programs to show the partial inverted index for the following these three files: 
 
 Input:
  file0's content -> "it is what it is" 
  file1's content -> "what is it" 
  file2's content -> "it is a banana" 
  
 Output:
  OutputFile ->
    a: {2} 
    banana: {2} 
    is: {0,1,2} 
    it: {0,1,2} 
    what: {0,1} 
    
    Explanation: We have to find the location of respective word (whether it's repeated or not) in each file 
                 and display in ascending order. The number shows the location of file (2 denotes second file2).
    
    
 Note: In this project I will upload only the .java file as I already have given smaple details in 
        https://github.com/SujitaPokharel/Map-Reduce-Projects/tree/master/Count%20Occurrence%20of%20First%20Character%20of%20Each%20word%20in%20all%20Files
