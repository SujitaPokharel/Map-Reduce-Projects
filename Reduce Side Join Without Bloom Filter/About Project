This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a Based on following information :

We are basically testing join operations. We have two files users.xml and comments.xml which we enriched with stackoverflow data.
We are performing all join operations to alter the data sets as per business requirements. 

Sample arguments while executing program:

    /home/cs246/Desktop/dataset/InputDataSet/users.xml
    /home/cs246/Desktop/dataset/InputDataSet/comments.xml
    /home/cs246/Desktop/output/join/fullouter
    
    keywords:
      full outer join = fullouter
      inner join = inner
      left outer join = leftouter
      right outer join = rightouter
      anti join = anti
