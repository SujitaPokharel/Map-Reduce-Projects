This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a prototype of :
  
  XML Parsing + MapReduce 
  Please find the word count of the text from the "Text" field
  Note: Your MapReduce program must contain Mapper, Reducer and Combiner. 
  
  Input:
    Sample Xml file
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <comments>
        <row Id="2" PostId="7" Score="0" Text="Deer Bear River" CreationDate="2010-08-17-17T19:38:20.410" UserId="11" />
        <row Id="3" PostId="13" Score="1" Text="Car Car River" CreationDate="2010-08-17-17T19:42:04.487" UserId="15" />
        ...
        <row Id="10" PostId="17" Score="0" Text="How now Brown cow" CreationDate="2010-08-17-17T19:52:28.863" UserId="58" />
      </comments>
      
   Output:
      Bear  1
      Brown 1
      Car 2
      cow 1
      Deer  1
      How 1
      now 1
      River 2
     Explanation: We have to parse the similar xml file where we have to count the word present in "Text" field of each row of the xml.
                  We have to use Mapper, reducer and combiner.
      
  Note: In this project I will upload only the .java file as I already have given smaple details in
