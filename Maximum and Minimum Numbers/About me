This is a part of assignment of Map Reduce Programming Using java (CS 570).
This project is a Based on following information :

    Find the minimum and maximum numbers from a sequence of numbers 
    and also utilize the MapReduce framework's counters utility to calculate how many malformed data lines.
    
    Input 
       file1:  
          2#4#1  
          5#6#2 
          
       file2:  
          5#7#8  
          8##9 <======= malformed 
          
       file3:  
          9#3#6  
          #5#2 <======= malformed 

    Note: 
     Malformed data will be skipped in the calculation for finding the minimum number. 
   
   Output 
   
    min 1 
    max 9 
    malformed 2 
    
    Explanation: Here '#' is seperator. Presence of '##' is a malform value which we skip in calculation. 
                 Likewise, speerator '#' should be between two numbers only else will be malformed and we skip that too.
    
    Note: 
      o The character "#" is used as the separator of numbers. 
      o String manipualtion. 
      o The result of the counter (i.e.,malformed) should be displayed by the driver (i.e., the main function).
